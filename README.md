# GraphAnalyzer
This project takes in a text file with each line describing a set of non-directional, adjacent vertices and creates a graph using an adjacency list representation. Once the graph is created, the following two functions can be called:
conn_coomponents --> created a list of lists which represents each subset of connectd components within the graph, this function uses DPS logic. 
is_bipartite--> verifies whether a graph is bicolorable, uses BFS logic.
